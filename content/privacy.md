For questions about this policy, to report data breaches, or to request information about retained personal data, contact me using the means provided on the [contact page]({{< ref "/contact" >}}).

## Automated data collection/processing

Like any website, my server automatically and temporarily collects and stores information transmitted by the browser in server log files (legal basis is Article 6(1) of GDPR). This includes e.g. the IP address of the requesting computer, the http response code, the referring website, the time of the server request as well as the browser type, browser version and operating system used on the requesting computer.

Identifiable information is not stored in these server log files, and the data is not combined with other data sources. This data can at no time be linked to specific people or specific persons.

## Collection/processing of voluntary data

If you provide personal data via e-mail or via this website (e.g. name, e-mail address, postal address), this is done on a voluntary basis. This data is used to process your requests and is only processed for the purpose for which you provided the data. In addition, I will only collect, process or use your data within the scope of statutory regulations (GDPR, Article 6(1)(c)) or with your explicit consent (GDPR, Article 6(1)(a)) that is revocable at any time.

I will not pass on your personal data to third parties unless I am obligated to do so by law or you have provided explicit prior consent. Insofar as I use the services of third parties to implement and execute processing procedures, I comply with the regulations of the GDPR as well as the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz = BDSG).

## Storage period

Personal data provided via this website is stored as long as required for the purpose for which it was given, and no longer. Note that if the personal data is subject to commercial and tax laws that require longer storage periods, that period may be up to 10 years.

These are needed to navigate the website, use basic functions and ensure the security of the website; they do not collect information about you for marketing purposes, nor do they store any information about third-party websites, or websites and pages that you have visited.

Your trust in me is important! I'm happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the processing of your personal data. I can be contacted via the means provided on the [contact page]({{< ref "/contact" >}}).

You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about my processing of your personal data.
