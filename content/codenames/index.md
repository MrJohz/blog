## Instructions

Use this page to play Codenames Duet using an existing Codenames or Codenames: Pictures set, or to play Codenames Duet without having to carry around the key cards.

You will need:

- Cards with random words on them (at least 25), typically from an existing Codenames set.
- 15 agent cards — you can use the red and blue cards from an existing Codenames set.
- 1 assasin card — technically this is optional, but it makes the end of the game more dramatic.
- 9 timer tokens, perhaps small coins or tokens from another game.
- Two phones or devices capable of loading this website.
- A set of the rules of Codenames Duet, available to download from the [Czech Games Website](https://www.czechgames.com/games/codenames-duet#downloads).

To use this page:

1. The first player opens this page on their device. If they've opened the page up before, they may want to press "New Key" to generate a new key card.
2. The first player sends the "share" link to the second player. They can do this by copying the URL in the text box above the key card and sending it to the second player, or by having the second player scan the QR code. (Note: the grid will be hidden while the QR code is open, to prevent the other players from seeing it accidentally.)
3. Both players can now use the key card on their device to play the game. See the official instructions for the game for more information.

**Important**: Both players should keep their devices in the same orientation, otherwise the cards will not work.
