Hi, I'm Jonathan! I'm a software developer based in Dresden, Germany. I work mainly in web development as a fullstack developer, specialising in the frontend development.  I mostly use TypeScript/JavaScript, as well as Python and occasionally Rust.

If you're interested in working with me, email me at {{< email email="jonathan.frere@gmail.com" >}}, or see my [contact page]({{< ref "/contact" >}}).  Alternatively, you can talk to my employer, [Esveo GmbH](https://www.esveo.com/en/), directly — we're always interested in new projects to work on!
