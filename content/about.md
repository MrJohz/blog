Hi, I'm Jonathan! I'm a software developer based in Dresden, Germany. I work mainly in web development as a frontend developer, although I'm also involved in plenty of other stuff as well. I am particularly interested in how to write and maintain software that works correctly, and how tools like programming language design and testing can contribute to that.

I'm not looking for new job opportunities at the moment, but if you're interested in what I'm doing, I do take on contract work through my employer [esveo](https://www.esveo.com/en/).
